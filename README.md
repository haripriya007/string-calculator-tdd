Please find my submission for the TDD assessment (String Calculator) implemented in Python. The project strictly follows the Test-Driven Development approach(Red Green Refactor), including unit tests and CI integration via GitHub Actions.

GitHub Repository:
https://github.com/haripriya007/string-calculator-tdd

Highlights:
Developed using Python with clean, readable code.

Followed TDD approach using unittest module.

Included test cases for all required scenarios including:

Empty string

Multiple delimiters (comma, newline)

Custom delimiters

Negative number exception handling

Each logical step is committed separately to show TDD progression.

Integrated with GitHub Actions for automated test runs on every push.

MIT License included.

Proper .gitignore and README added with instructions and screenshots.
